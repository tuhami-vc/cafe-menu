# HTML and CSS Cafe Menu

A responsive cafe menu created with HTML and CSS. This project is a practical application of the fundamental concepts 
learned in the freeCodeCamp "Responsive Web Design" certification.

This project is built by following the "Learn Basic CSS by Building a Cafe Menu" tutorial on freeCodeCamp. You can see

## üöÄ Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to build a visually appealing and well-structured web page using core HTML and
CSS skills. It serves as a hands-on exercise to solidify the understanding of concepts taught by freeCodeCamp.

### Key Learning Goals Applied:

*   **Semantic HTML:** Structuring the content logically for both browsers and developers.
*   **CSS Fundamentals:** Applying styles using various selectors, properties, and values.
*   **The Box Model:** Mastering the concepts of `margin`, `padding`, `border`, and `content`.
*   **Typography:** Styling text elements to create a readable and aesthetically pleasing menu.
*   **Layout Techniques:** Using CSS to position and align elements, such as centering content.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the cafe menu.
*   **CSS3:** For all styling, including colors, fonts, spacing, and layout.
